Project Accomplishment:

This repository contains a Branch Predictor Simulator. The simulator models branch prediction mechanisms commonly used in computer architecture and evaluates their performance across various configurations and trace files.

# Project Overview

The Branch Predictor Simulator aims to model and analyze the following types of branch predictors:

Bimodal Predictor: A simple predictor using only the branch's program counter (PC) for indexing.

Gshare Predictor: A global-history-based predictor that combines the branch's PC with global branch history.

Hybrid Predictor: A selector mechanism between the bimodal and gshare predictors, based on a chooser table.

Each predictor configuration is tested for its misprediction rate to assess its effectiveness in minimizing branch mispredictions.

# Features

Bimodal Predictor: Uses low-order bits of the PC to form an index into a table of 2-bit counters, predicting the outcome of branches.

Gshare Predictor: Utilizes an XOR of the global history register with the upper bits of the PC for prediction, allowing for history-based predictions.

Hybrid Predictor (ECE 563 only): Chooses between bimodal and gshare predictions based on the outcomes of a chooser table.

The simulator processes branch traces and outputs metrics to evaluate each predictorâ€™s performance, including the total number of predictions, number of mispredictions, and the misprediction rate.

Requirements

Build Tools: Makefile

# File Structure
src/sim_bp.c, src/sim_bp.h: Source code for the simulator.
Makefile: Build configuration.
README.md: Project documentation.

# How to Execute

1. Type "make" to build.  (Type "make clean" first if you already compiled and want to recompile from scratch.)
 
Run trace reader:
 
To run without throttling output:
./sim bimodal 6 gcc_trace.txt
./sim gshare 9 3 gcc_trace.txt
./sim hybrid 8 14 10 5 gcc_trace.txt

To run with throttling (via "less"):
./sim bimodal 6 gcc_trace.txt | less
./sim gshare 9 3 gcc_trace.txt | less
./sim hybrid 8 14 10 5 gcc_trace.txt | less
